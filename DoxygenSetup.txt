1. Download -> http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html
2. open a terminal in the folder you are working in (shift+right click--> open Terminal or PowerShell)
3. type: doxygen -g 
	a. Alternatively you can just copy my "Doxyfile" from the cloud!
	WARNING: your folder with the source code will need to be called sw, you can change just INPUT, see 4.

4. open the generated doxygen file (called Doxyfile as default) (e.g. Notepad)
	a. change PROJECT_NAME = CubeSat
	b. RECURSIVE = YES
	c. OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = doc (or whatever you want to call it)
	d. INPUT = sw (or wherever your code is)
	e. OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_C = YES

4. Document your code in the doxygen style! (see http://fnch.users.sourceforge.net/doxygen_c.html for more details)
the documentation should at least contain [optionals], () -->recommended if not really simple:
	a. for every file:
		/** @file filename  		
	    	* @brief this is a brief description 	
	    	* [@author xy
		* @date xy]
		* 
		* @details Longer description
		*/ 
	b. for functions:
		/**
 		* @brief brief descr
 		* 
		* @details (Longer description)
 		* @param paramname1 descr
		* @param paramname2 descr
		* ....
 		* @return descr of return value
		*/
6. Now you can generate the docs with: doxygen Doxyfile (in Terminal!)
	a. The warnings should show you code that isn't document/not formated well!
7. you can view the generated output if you open doc/html/index.html, alternatively you can build a .pdf from latex source.
